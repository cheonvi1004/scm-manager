   * <br />
   * <br />
   * <ol>
   *   <li>
   *     Invoke the {@link ClassLoader#findClass(String)} method to find the
   *     class.
   *   </li>
   *   <li>
   *     Invoke {@link ClassLoader#findLoadedClass(String)} to check if
   *     the class has already been loaded.
   *   </li>
   *   <li>
   *     Invoke the {@link ClassLoader#loadClass(String)} method on the parent
   *     class loader. If the parent is null the class loader built-in to the
   *     virtual machine is used, instead.
   *   </li>
   * </ol>
   *
   * If the class was found using the above steps, and the {@code resolve} flag
   * is true, this method will then invoke the {@link #resolveClass(Class)}
   * method on the resulting Class object. Subclasses of ClassLoader are
   * encouraged to override {@link ClassLoader#findClass(String)}, rather than
   * this method.
   *
   * @param name the name of the class
