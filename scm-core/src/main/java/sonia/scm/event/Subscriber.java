/**
 * The subscriber annotation could be use to register listener classes to the 
 * {@link ScmEventBus}. A registered listener object can use the 
 * {@link Subscribe} annotation for methods to receive events, 
 * for more informations have a look at {@link ScmEventBus}. The annotated object 
 * is only bind to the {@link ScmEventBus}, if the the object is loaded from the
 * injection system of SCM-Manager. If your object is not loaded by the 
 * injection system you have to register your object by yourself with the 
 * {@link ScmEventBus#register(Object, boolean)} method. If you would like to 
 * register object which is a "listener only" object you have to use the 
 * {@link EagerSingleton} scope for your object. E.g.:
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 *   {@code @}Extension
 *   {@code @}Subscriber
 *   {@code @}EagerSingleton
 *   public class MyListener {
 * 
 *     @Subscribe
 *     public void receiveEvent(Event event){
 *       // do something with the event
 *     }
 * 
 *   }
 * </code></pre>
